I am a student journalist going into my senior year at the University of Maryland. My main area of focus is sports journalism.

Experience:


Staff writer 
Testudo Times
2023-present 
I cover the University of Maryland Wrestling team. I do all home matches and some away matches where I make notes of significant wins, score changes, and more. I will also conduct post-game interviews with players and coaches. After a match, I will write an article using my notes and interviews. From there, I will send my editor my article and wait for it to be reviewed, edited and published.
